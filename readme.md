> Easily switch terminal color themes

## Why

I needed a simple program to switch the color theme of all the terminals I use. So I wrote one.

## CLI

Please see the README for [teems-cli](https://github.com/cideM/teems-cli)

### Getting started

```shell
npm install --global teems
cd ~/.config/teems
vim themes.json           # Modifiy/add themes
teems-cli [name of theme] # Activate theme
```

```shell
teems-cli --help
```

It looks for configuration files for each supported app. It reads each file and replaces color values with values from the theme you are activating. Before each operation, it performs a backup of all affected files.

An example theme file can be found in the install directory of **teems**, usually `$HOME/.config/teems`. Simply add more themes to the array and make sure that foreground, background and colors 0-15 are provided.
